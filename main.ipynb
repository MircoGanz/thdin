    "\n",
    "Steady-state thermal–hydraulic network models are widely used for the analysis,\n",
    "design, and operation of energy systems such as refrigeration cycles, heat\n",
    "pumps, and district heating networks. These systems are characterized by\n",
    "strongly coupled mass, momentum, and energy transport phenomena, leading to\n",
    "large nonlinear algebraic equation systems even under steady-state conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many practical applications, two distinct classes of problems arise.\n",
    "In **direct problems**, system inputs such as boundary conditions, geometric\n",
    "parameters, or control variables are prescribed, and the objective is to\n",
    "compute the resulting steady-state operating point of the system. In contrast,\n",
    "**inverse problems** aim to determine suitable input values such that prescribed\n",
    "performance targets or operating constraints are satisfied. Typical examples\n",
    "include set-point tracking, capacity control, and parameter identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical approaches commonly address inverse problems through repeated\n",
    "solution of the corresponding direct problem, often embedded within an outer\n",
    "optimization loop. While conceptually straightforward, such nested strategies\n",
    "can become computationally expensive and numerically fragile for large-scale\n",
    "networks with strong nonlinear couplings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a unified methodology for the formulation and\n",
    "solution of both direct and inverse steady-state thermal–hydraulic problems\n",
    "within a single modeling framework. The approach combines causal\n",
    "(input–output) component models with acausal (implicit) balance equations at\n",
    "the network level. System-level coupling is enforced through mass, energy, and\n",
    "pressure equality relations at junctions, while an established\n",
    "tripartite-graph-based tearing strategy (Huang et al. 2021)is used to reduce the dimensionality of\n",
    "the resulting nonlinear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of the methodology is the formulation of inverse problems using a\n",
    "**simultaneous analysis and design (SAND)** approach (Martins et al. 2022). Instead of repeatedly\n",
    "solving the forward problem, selected system inputs and tearing variables are\n",

    "quantities are minimized within a single constrained optimization problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "In contrast to classical approaches, in which inverse problems are typically\n",

    "**unified steady-state formulation**. In particular, inverse problems are posed\n",

    "\n",
    "Within this framework, the tearing variables $\\mathbf{z}$ and a selected subset\n",
    "of system inputs $\\mathbf{u}^{var}$ are treated as unknowns\n",
    "simultaneously, while the remaining system inputs $\\mathbf{u}^{fix}$\n",
    "remain prescribed. This reflects an inversion of computational causality: some\n",
    "quantities that are physically interpreted as inputs are solved for numerically\n",
    "in order to meet prescribed system-level targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse problem is solved by enforcing all steady-state mass, energy, and\n",

    "the mismatch between simulated system outputs and prescribed target quantities\n",

    "This notebook demonstrated the application of the proposed steady-state\n",
    "thermal–hydraulic modeling framework to both direct and inverse problem\n",
    "formulations using a vapor compression refrigeration cycle as a\n",
    "test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the thermo-hydraulic network was constructed from modular component\n",
    "models with explicitly defined computational causality. System-level coupling\n",
    "and physical consistency were enforced implicitly through junction balance\n",
    "equations. An established tearing strategy was applied to reduce the nonlinear\n",
    "equation system to a small set of tearing variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the direct problem, all system inputs were prescribed and the reduced\n",
    "nonlinear system was solved to obtain the steady-state operating point and\n",
    "associated performance quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the inverse problem, selected system inputs were declared as optimization\n",
    "variables using the `is_var` mechanism. Desired operating conditions were\n",
    "formulated as objective-type constraints, while all steady-state balance\n",
    "equations and physical closure relations were enforced simultaneously. This\n",
    "resulted in a single constrained optimization problem consistent with the\n",
    "simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) formulation presented in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results illustrate that the framework enables a unified and transparent\n",
    "treatment of direct and inverse steady-state thermal–hydraulic problems without\n",
    "requiring nested solution strategies. Implemented in Python, the framework\n",
    "supports reproducible modeling workflows and provides a flexible foundation\n",
    "for set-point-driven analysis, design, and optimization of coupled\n",
    "thermal–hydraulic energy systems.\n"
